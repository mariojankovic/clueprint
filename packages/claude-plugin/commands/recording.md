Call `mcp__clueprint__recording` to get the most recent flow recording.

The user starts recordings by clicking "Record" in the browser widget, performs actions, then clicks "Stop".

The recording contains a timeline of user interactions, network requests, and any errors that occurred.

If the user provided a task, help debug the recorded flow. Otherwise, summarize what was recorded.
